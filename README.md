# amazoneclone
I created a static Amazon Clone homepage using only HTML and CSS, replicating the visual design and layout of Amazon’s official website. This project focuses on front-end development skills, using clean semantic HTML and modern CSS layout techniques.

Key Features:

 1.Fully responsive layout using Flexbox

 2.Navigation bar with dropdown-style layout and a search input

 3.Product sections styled with images and hover effects

 4.Banner area for promotions (e.g. Mother’s Day offer section)

 5.Organized footer replicating Amazon’s services grid

 6.Consistent color scheme and typography inspired by Amazon

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 for layout, styling, and responsiveness

This project showcases my ability to recreate professional web designs using only front-end technologies, without any JavaScript or backend logic.
