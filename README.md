# amazoneclone
Created a responsive Amazon homepage clone using only HTML and CSS. Reproduced key sections like the navbar, hero banner, product listings, and footer with Flexbox for layout and clean, semantic HTML. Focused on visual accuracy and responsiveness to showcase front-end design skills without JavaScript.
